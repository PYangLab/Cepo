![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/PYangLab/Cepo/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg) [![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/PYangLab/Cepo/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=sJROwPzwey)](https://codecov.io/gh/PYangLab/Cepo)

Defining the identity of a cell is fundamental to understand the heterogeneity of cells to various environmental signals and perturbations. We present Cepo, a new method to explore cell identities from single-cell RNA-sequencing data using differential stability as a new metric to define cell identity genes. Cepo computes cell-type specific gene statistics pertaining to differential stable gene expression. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of _Cepo_ that can be installed from GitHub
using the `remotes` package:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("PYangLab/Cepo")
```

You can install the Bioconductor version of _Cepo_ from:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("Cepo")
```

To also build the vignettes use:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("PYangLab/Cepo", dependencies = TRUE,
                         build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

**NOTE:** Building the vignettes requires the installation of additional
packages.

## Documentation

The documentation for _Cepo_ is available from http://github.io/PYangLab/Cepo
